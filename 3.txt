In the away Border-Gavaskar trophy in 2014,
moments after helping India draw the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne,
Dhoni announced that he was stepping down from Test captaincy and retiring from Test cricket,
citing excessive workload as the reason for quitting the longest format.
After honing a potent bowling attack and a gritty batting line-up for his heir,
and taking several body blows - literal and metaphorical -
Dhoni ensured that he copped the criticism to nurture a potent team and left his successor a young,
zealous team with the tenacity, fitness, and most importantly,
the positive attitude to perform in all conditions.
