Rohit was subsequently picked for the ODI team on a selection whim after his burst of vital performances
 in the World T20 and his impressive Ranji Trophy record.
 He made an impression in the CB series Down Under,
 playing some crucial cameos against stalwarts like Brett Lee and Stuart Clark,
 and a more-than-competent Sri Lankan attack.
 These inspired away performances in the World T20 and the CB series caught the eye of the selectors,
 and warranted him an extended run with the limited-overs side.
